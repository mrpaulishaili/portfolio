        <p>
          My name is Paul Ishaili and I am a Web Developer and Software
          Engineer, who loves to build and impact through developing software
          solutions and platforms for businesses and entrepreneurs individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also a Tech Writer on the Dev Community with a number of articles
          that have helped a lot of people in their coding experiences,
          engagements, and developments.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have worked with many small businesses to grow their brand awareness
          in their environs, generate leads, and be set for expansion, by
          growing more profit from satisfied customers and clients.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have also helped many entrepreneurs individuals, business owners,
          and brands, within Africa, to discover their Unique Selling Point
          (USP), and identity and develop implementable strategic plans in
          penetrating their market, building consistent trust, communication,
          and understanding with the general market that have the highest POV
          (Point of View) for their brand and deliverables (products and
          services).
        </p>
        <p>
          As a Software Engineer, I wear many hats within the industry: A
          creative director, tech lead, full-stack web developer, frontend
          developer, backend developer with NodeJS, system administrator, and
          webmaster.
